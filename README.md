# DSA Assignment: Linear Structures 2 (REQUIRED)

This problem uses **linear data structures**.

Accepting the GitHub Assignment will create a repo with a challenge at `/src/main/java/tech.strategio` and its corresponding unit tests at `/src/test/java/tech.strategio`. Clone the repo generated for you by GitHub Classroom and use your Java IDE of choice.

The exercise contains a class with a method. Complete the method in an IDE such that the unit tests pass. You should run your unit tests often, either through your Java IDE or through the command line (`gradle test`).

To submit the exercise, push a commit to GitHub. Automated tests will run, and youâ€™ll see a green checkbox if ALL unit tests pass.
